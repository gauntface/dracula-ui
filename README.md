## :thinking: Why

**NOTE:** This is not THE dracula-ui theme! This is a variant of it.

I started using the dracula UI theme, liked it enough that I wanted
to use it for a UI for a microcontroller project, but that meant
cutting down the styles included in my pages.

This lead to this repo. A small, BEM named, cut down version of the
dracula-ui.

There should be much of a difference beyond:

1. There is no JS framework support, just plain CSS here.
1. No single file to import all styles

**For most people, this isn't the module for you**.

## :package: Install

You can install Dracula UI via npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install @gauntface/dracula-ui
```
